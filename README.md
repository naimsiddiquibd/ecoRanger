**Team EcoRangers presents EcoRanger – A Fun Way to Learn Environmental Science**

## Introduction
Welcome to **EcoRanger**, an educational and interactive mobile game designed to teach children about environmental science in an exciting and engaging way. This app utilizes the **GLOBE Protocol** and real **NASA data** to create immersive gameplay experiences, helping kids understand key environmental concepts while promoting real-world actions to improve our planet.

## Project Overview
EcoRanger was developed by **Team EcoRangers** to address the growing issue of video game addiction in children by transforming gameplay into an educational tool. The game offers a variety of protocol-based games covering environmental topics such as the **atmosphere**, **hydrosphere**, and more. By interacting with real-world scientific concepts, kids learn about the **water cycle**, **air quality**, and how to monitor environmental changes using GLOBE Protocols.

In addition to the core games, EcoRanger features a **quiz game** where players can challenge friends, answer questions, and earn points to foster friendly competition and learning. Kids can also register for upcoming **webinars and meetings**, gaining direct access to expert knowledge and learning opportunities about environmental protocols.

## Key Features
- **Avatar Selection & Personalization**: Players begin by selecting their avatar, entering their name and country for a personalized experience.
- **Protocol-Based Games**: Interactive learning covering key environmental topics like atmosphere and hydrosphere, with data verified by NASA’s GLOBE Protocol.
- **Real-World Simulations**: Learn about cloud formation, water quality, and environmental impacts through hands-on, protocol-driven tasks.
- **Quiz Game**: Challenge friends, answer short questions, earn points, and gain knowledge through fun competitions.
- **Webinar Registration**: Stay updated with notifications about new webinars and meetings related to environmental science.
- **AI-Driven Personalization**: Future plans to integrate AI to monitor children's activities and provide tailored guidelines for improving the environment.

## Educational Impact
EcoRanger leverages immersive storytelling, real NASA data, and hands-on learning to create an impactful educational experience. Children will not only play games but also gain a deeper understanding of environmental science topics such as:
- The Atmosphere and air quality
- The Hydrosphere and water quality
- The interconnectedness of Earth's systems
- How environmental changes affect the planet

By engaging in protocol-based tasks and simulations, kids will earn badges that mark their progress, empowering them to take real-world actions and make informed decisions about environmental sustainability.

## Team
**Team EcoRangers** is composed of five passionate individuals dedicated to creating an impactful learning experience for kids. Led by **Fuad Hasan**, the team includes **Abdullah Fahim**, **Saikot Hasan**, **Naim Siddiqui**, and **Ambia Omor Faiza**. With expertise in environmental science, technology, and game design, the team has crafted EcoRanger to be both fun and educational, inspiring the next generation to care for the environment.

## Future Vision
EcoRanger is not just a game; it’s a step towards creating a more environmentally conscious generation. The project aims to expand with **40 additional protocols** and **AI-driven personalized guidelines**, enabling children to continue learning and taking actionable steps to protect the environment long after they complete the game's current tasks.
